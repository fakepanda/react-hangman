# react-hangman
You know, it's a hangman game where you guess the Game of Thrones character.

## Status: WIP
This is a personal project to play around with React and webpack. Status: WIP, works but ain't pretty.

Build with `npm run build` and open the index.html from a browser OR just go to this [live page](https://fakepanda.github.io/react-hangman).

To launch a server with hot-loader capabilities run `npm run dev` and go to `localhost:4001/bundle` or `localhost:4001/webpack-dev-server/bundle`

Answer keys are Game of Thrones characters collected using a [web scraper](https://github.com/fakepanda/wiki-got-scraper).

TODOs:
  - page needs some style, make hangman pretty again
  - play next game button
  - actually show a hanging man
  - show image of character after 3 mistakes
  - reveal answer after exhausing all 3 attempts
