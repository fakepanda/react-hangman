# react-hangman
This is a personal project to play around with React and webpack. Status: WIP, works but ain't pretty.

Build with `npm run build` and open the index.html from a browser.

To launch a server with hot-loader capabilities run `npm run dev` and go to `localhost:4001/bundle` or `localhost:4001/webpack-dev-server/bundle`
